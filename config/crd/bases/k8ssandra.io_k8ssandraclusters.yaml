                                          is simply exec'd, it is not run inside a
                                          shell, so traditional shell instructions
                                          ('|', etc) won't work. To use a shell, you
                                          need to explicitly call out to that shell.

                                          the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                          * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                          types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                          non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using
                                          this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                                              root ('/') in the container's filesystem.

                                    between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While
                                    DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                                    DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well
                                    as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource
                                    ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if
                                    a disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using

                                    once the pod exists. Normally this should not

                                            of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                            object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                            objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                            values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an
                                            error if a disallowed value is specified.

                                    backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource
                                    and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. There are two important differences
                                    between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While
                                    DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                                    DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well
                                    as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource
                                    ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if
                                    a disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using

                              DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as
                              PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores
                              disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                              all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value
                              is specified. (Alpha) Using this field requires the

                              New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                              describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                              fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                              honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                              are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                              usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                              individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                              particular restrictions like, "must refer only to types
                              A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                              Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                              validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                              rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                              users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are
                              both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                              mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during
                              interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most
                              cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                              and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                              5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                              embedded in many locations, updates to this type will
                              affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed
                              an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead
                              of using this type, create a locally provided and used
                              type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                                  such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For
                                  example, if the object reference is to a container
                                  within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                                  (where "name" refers to the name of the container
                                  that triggered the event) or if no container name
