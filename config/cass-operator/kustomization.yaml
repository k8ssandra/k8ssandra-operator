# The cass-operator-crb ClusterRoleBinding requires a namespace for the ServiceAccount.
# Running `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -` directly against this directory will fail
# since the namespace is not declared. You will instead need to run against another
# kustomization.yaml that declares the namespace and that declares this parent directory as
# a resource.

namespace: default
