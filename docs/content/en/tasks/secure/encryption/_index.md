description: Setting up encryption in K8ssandra clusters.
---

Apache Cassandra&reg; offers the ability to encrypt internode communications and client-to-node communications separately. This topic explains how to set up and configure encryption in K8ssandra clusters.

## Prerequisites

* A supported Kubernetes 1.19+ environment, either local (kind, K3D, minikube) or via a cloud provider:
  * Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
  * DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)
  * Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in a Google Cloud project
  * Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* **K8ssandra Operator** has been installed - see the [install]({{< relref "install" >}}) topics
* An SSL encryption store, as covered in the next section

## Generating SSL encryption stores

If you do not have a set of encryption stores available, follow the instructions in [this TLP blog post](https://thelastpickle.com/blog/2021/06/15/cassandra-certificate-management-part_1-how-to-rotate-keys.html). More specifically, use [this script](https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra-toolbox/tree/main/generate_cluster_ssl_stores) to generate the SSL stores.

You could clone the [cassandra-toolbox](https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra-toolbox) GitHub repository, and create a `cert.conf` file with the following format:

```conf
[ req ]
distinguished_name     = req_distinguished_name
prompt                 = no
output_password        = MyPassWord123!
default_bits           = 3072

[ req_distinguished_name ]
C                      = FR
ST                     = IDF
L                      = Paris
O                      = YourCompany
OU                     = SSLTestCluster
CN                     = SSLTestClusterRootCA
emailAddress           = youraddress@whatever.com
```

Next, run:

```bash
./generate_cluster_ssl_stores.sh -v 10000 -g cert.conf
```

The `-v` value above sets the validity of the generated certificates in days. 

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
Don't set this `-v` days value too low. Doing so would require you to rotate the certificates too often; it's not a trivial operation.
{{% /alert %}}

The command output should be a folder containing a keystore, a truststore, and a file containing their respective passwords.

Rename the keystore file to `keystore`, and rename the truststore file to `truststore`. Then create a Kubernetes secret with the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic server-encryption-stores --from-file=keystore --from-literal=keystore-password=<keystore password> --from-file=truststore --from-literal=truststore-password=<truststore password> -o yaml > server-encryption-stores.yaml
```

Replace the `<keystore password>` and `<truststore password>` above with each store's actual password.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
You can repeat the above procedure to generate encryption stores for client-to-node encryption, changing the secret name appropriately.
Check the following section for more details on setting up client encryption with Medusa.
{{% /alert %}}

### Medusa client certificates

In order to work with a cluster with client to node encryption, Medusa will require an additional client certificate to be created.
First, create a `client.conf` file with the matching the root CA conf:

```conf
[ req ]
distinguished_name     = req_distinguished_name
prompt                 = no
output_password        = MyPassWord123!
default_bits           = 3072

[ req_distinguished_name ]
C                      = FR
O                      = YourCompany
OU                     = SSLTestCluster
CN                     = client
```

Then, run the following command to create the certificate/key pair:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:3078 -nodes -keyout client.key -out client.csr -config client.conf
```

When generating the encryption stores in the previous step, you should have created a root CA certificate and key. You can find them in the `certs` folder, with names like `ca_<date_time>.cert` and `ca_<date_time>.key`.
Rename them as : `rootca.crt` and `rootca.key`.   
Now, sign the client certificate using these files:
  
```bash
openssl x509 -req -CA rootca.crt -CAkey rootca.key -passin pass:MyPassWord123! -in client.csr -out client.crt_signed -days 3650 -CAcreateserial
```

Finally, create a Kubernetes secret with the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic client-certificates --from-file=rootca.crt --from-file=client.key --from-file=client.crt_signed  -o yaml > client-certificates.yaml
```


## Creating a cluster with internode encryption

In order to create a K8ssandra cluster with encryption, first create a namespace and the encryption stores secrets previously generated in it.

In the `K8ssandraCluster` manifest, you will need to configure encryption settings in the `config/cassandraYaml` section.

Also, you'll need to reference the encryption stores' secrets under:

* `cassandra/serverEncryptionStores` 
* *Or*`cassandra/clientEncryptionStores`

Server encryption and client encryption are different entities. They both have their own keystore/truststore pair.
The "or" here shows that you can turn on either independently, or both. Server is for internode communications encryption, and client is for client-to-node communications encryption.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8ssandra.io/v1alpha1
kind: K8ssandraCluster
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  cassandra:
    serverVersion: "4.0.1"
    storageConfig:
      cassandraDataVolumeClaimSpec:
        storageClassName: standard
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi
    config:
      cassandraYaml:
        server_encryption_options:
            internode_encryption: all
            require_client_auth: true
            ...
            ...
        client_encryption_options:
            enabled: true
            require_client_auth: true
            ...
            ...
    datacenters:
      - metadata:
          name: dc1
        size: 3
    serverEncryptionStores:
      keystoreSecretRef:
        name: server-encryption-stores
      truststoreSecretRef:
        name: server-encryption-stores
    clientEncryptionStores:
      keystoreSecretRef:
        name: client-encryption-stores
      truststoreSecretRef:
        name: client-encryption-stores
```

Enabling client-to-node encryption will also encrypt JMX communications. Running Cassandra `nodetool` commands will then require additional arguments to pass the encryption stores and their passwords.

{{% alert title="Note" color="success" %}}
Again, server (internode) and client (client-to-node) encryption are totally independent and can be enabled/disabled individually, as well as use different encryption stores.
{{% /alert %}}

## Stargate and Reaper encryption

Stargate and Reaper will both inherit from Cassandra's encryption settings without any additional change to the manifest.

An encrypted cluster with both Stargate and Reaper would be deployed with the following manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8ssandra.io/v1alpha1
kind: K8ssandraCluster
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  cassandra:
    serverVersion: "4.0.1"
    storageConfig:
      cassandraDataVolumeClaimSpec:
        storageClassName: standard
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi
    config:
      cassandraYaml:
        server_encryption_options:
            internode_encryption: all
            require_client_auth: true
            ...
            ...
        client_encryption_options:
            enabled: true
            require_client_auth: true
            ...
            ...
    datacenters:
      - metadata:
          name: dc1
        size: 3
    serverEncryptionStores:
      keystoreSecretRef:
        name: server-encryption-stores
      truststoreSecretRef:
        name: server-encryption-stores
    clientEncryptionStores:
      keystoreSecretRef:
        name: client-encryption-stores
      truststoreSecretRef:
        name: client-encryption-stores
  stargate:
    size: 1
  reaper:
    deploymentMode: SINGLE
```

## Medusa encryption

In order to work with a cluster that has client-to-node encryption enabled, Medusa needs to use a matching certificate (consisting of client certificate and key, as well as the root CA certificate) that the Python Driver can use.

This certificate can be generated with the command mentioned above. Result will be a single `Secret` holding all the various components under hard-coded keys.

After having created the `client-certificates`Â secret, you will need to reference it in the `medusa` section of the `K8ssandraCluster` manifest:

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  medusa:
    certificatesSecretRef:
      name: client-certificates
```

However, this aproach is too prescriptive and we decided to deprecate it. As a replacement, we added `clientEncryptionStores` field to `medusa`'s spec. It allows more flexible control of where do Medusa's certificates come from.

To achieve the same behaviour as `certificatesSecretRef` (to use a certificate generated with the command earlier), the spec should look like this:

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  medusa:
    clientEncryptionStores:
      keystoreSecretRef:
        name: client-certificates
        key: rootca.crt
      truststoreSecretRef:
        name: client-certificates
        key: client.crt_signed
      truststorePasswordSecretRef:
        name: client-certificates
        key: client.key
```

The `clientEncryptionStores` also feature `KeystorePasswordRef`, which is ignored in this case. When both `certificatesSecretRef` and `clientEncryptionStores` are set, the operator will use `certificatesSecretRef` and log a line about doing so.
