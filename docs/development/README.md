# Custom Resource Definitions

## Type definitions
The Go type definition for custom resources live under the `api` directory in files with a `_types.go` suffix. The CRDs are derived from the structs defined in these files.

## Updating CRDs
As mentioned previously, the CRDs are generated based off the contents of the `_types.go` files. The CRDs live under `config/crd`.

Run `make manifests` to update CRDs. This will generate new manifest files, but it does not install them in the k8s cluster.

**Note:** Any changes to the `_types.go` files should be followed by `make manifests`.

## Deploying CRDs
`make install` will update CRDs and then deploy them.

If you are doing multi-cluster dev/testing, make sure you update the CRDs in each cluster, e.g.,

```
$ kubectx kind-k8ssandra-0

$ make install

$ kubectx kind-k8ssandra-1

$ make install
```

# Building operator image
Build the operator image with:

```
make docker-build
```

This will build `k8ssandra/k8ssandra-operator:latest`. You can build different image coordinates by setting the `IMG` var:

```
make IMG=jsanda/k8ssandra-operator:latest docker-build
```

## Load the operator image into kind clusters
Assuming you have two kind clusters, load the operator image with `make kind-load-image`:

```
make KIND_CLUSTER=k8ssandra-0 kind-load-image
```
and

```
make KIND_CLUSTER=k8ssandra-1 kind-load-image
```

# Install the operator

## Cert Manager
Cass Operator has a dependency on Cert Manager. It needs to be installed first. Assuming you have two kind clusters, install with:

```
kubectx kind-k8ssandra-0

make cert-manager
```
and

```
kubectx kind-k8ssandra-1

make cert-manager
```

## k8ssandra-operator
`make deploy` performs a default installation in the `default` namespace. This includes:

* cass-operator
* cass-operator CRDs
* k8ssandra-operator
* k8ssandra-operator CRDs

**Note:** We need to add support for deploying the operator configured for data plane mode (see [#131](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra-operator/issues/131)).


# Running tests
## Unit and integration tests

`make test` runs both unit and integration tests. 

Integration tests use the `envtest` package from controller-runtime.  See this [section](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/envtest.html) of the kubebuilder book for background on `envtest`.

**Note:** If you want to run integration tests from your IDE you need to set the `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS` env var. It should point to `<project-root>/testbin/bin`.

## Running e2e tests
End-to-end tests require kind clusters that are built with the `scripts/setup-kind-multicluster.sh` script. 

**Note:** There are plans to add the ability to run the tests against other clusters. This is being tracked in [#112](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra-operator/issues/112).

### Create the kind clusters
The multi-cluster tests require two clusters.

```
./scripts/setup-kind-multicluster.sh --clusters 2
```

### Build operator image

Before running tests, build the operator image:

```
make docker-build
```

### Load the operator image into the clusters
Load the operator image with `make kind-load-image`:

```
make KIND_CLUSTER=k8ssandra-0 kind-load-image
```

```
make KIND_CLUSTER=k8ssandra-1 kind-load-image
```

### Run the tests

`make e2e-tests` runs the tests under `test/e2e`.

If you want to run a single test, set the `E2E_TEST` variable as follows:

```
make E2E_TEST=TestOperator/SingleDatacenterCluster e2e-test
```

### Resource Requirements
Multi-cluster tests will be more resource intensive than other tests. The Docker VM on my MacBook Pro is configured with 6 CPUs and  10 GB of memory for these tests. Your mileage may vary on other operating systems/setups.
